.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.PP
Nuzzle is a terminal based puzzle game collection. It is implemented with 
ncurses and requires color and mouse support.

The target of the game is to place as much blocks as possible, from a home area
to the game area. If the blocks on the game area form a certain pattern, they 
will be removed and the player gets one point for each block that was removed.

There are 3 games that are supported:
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fILines\fR
The game is played with one color. If a complete row or column is filled with
blocks, they will be removed.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fILines-squares\fR
The game is played with one color. The game area consists of 9x9 blocks with 9
squares, that consists of 3x3 blocks. If a complete row or column is filled with
blocks or if one of the 9 squares is filled with blocks the blocks will be
removed.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fI4-Colors\fR
The game is played with 4 colors. If 4 or more adjacent blocks with the same
color exist, then they will be removed.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.P
The game can be played with the mouse and/or the keyboard. The following keys
are supported.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP <ESC>
Show the main menu during the game.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP <TAB>
Pick up a block in the home area or loop through the home area, if a block is 
already picked up.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP <ARROW-KEY>
If the blocks from the home area were not inside the game area, they are moved 
to the first possible drop area on the game area. If the blocks are inside the
game area, the blocks can be moved with the arrow keys.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP <ENTER>
Drop to blocks on the game area if it is possible.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP <q>
Quit the game.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.P 
To play nuzzle with the mouse, you can simply left click on the home area to 
pick up the blocks. Once the blocks are picked up you can move the blocks with 
the mouse. The mouse needs not to be pressed to move the blocks. A right click 
moves the blocks back to the home area. If blocks are picked up and moved to the 
game area, another left click drops the blocks on the game area, if this is 
possible.

.SH FILES 
Nuzzle uses the following configuration files:
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP nuzzle.cfg
The file contains the configurations for the three games.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP color.cfg
The file contains the definitions of the colors that are used within the nuzzle. 
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP "5-shapes.cfg shapes-lines.cfg"
The two file contain the definitions of the various block structures that are 
used in the \fILines\fR and \fISquares-Lines\fR games.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.P
Nuzzle references the configuration files with their names. The default files 
from the installation can be overwritten. Each configuration file is resolved by 
looking in the following directories in the given order. To overwrite one or 
more of the files, copy a the default file to one of the directies.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP ${PWD}/cfg/
Nuzzle first looks in the \fIcfg\fR directory inside the working directory of 
the user. This is necessary to ensure that nuzzle finds configurations after a
build with \fImake\fR. 
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP ${HOME}/.nuzzle/
Nuzzle uses this directory to store user specific files like the score files for
the games. This is the recommended directory to place customized configuration
files.
