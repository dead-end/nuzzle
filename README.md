# Nuzzle (N-curses p-UZZLE)

Nuzzle is a terminal based puzzle game. It is implemented with ncurses and requires color and mouse support. Playing is simple:
                                                                                    
- Start the program and start a new game.                                           
                                                                                    
- Use ESC to enter the main menu during the game.                                   
                                                                                    
- Click on the block of squares to pick them up.                                    
                                                                                    
- Move the block to the desired position.                                           
                                                                                    
- Click again to drop the block of squares at that position. It is not necessary to hold the button pressed while moving the blocks.
                                                                                    
- If more than 4 adjacent blocks exist, then they are removed from the game. For each removed block you get one point for your score.
